# Description

In this project, a specific RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), a LSTM (Long
Short Term Memory) was trained on a part of the Seinfield dataset of scripts.
The Seinfield dataset can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv)
After the training, a new, 'fake' tv script was generated, which is listed below.
The generated sentences all make sense, the punctuation is correct and even
the sitcom's style is well reflected.
